### Story 

Callback functionality is an essential feature in a modern contact center, providing a solution that enhances both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Imagine a customer calls to upgrade their service but faces a 20-minute wait, they can request a callback instead of staying on hold. If no agents are available, they’ll be offered the choice to remain in the queue or opt for a callback. Upon choosing the callback, they provide their number, which is validated, and the system schedules the call. Once an agent is free, the system connects with the customer. This ensures businesses retain leads while providing a seamless customer experience.

### Build
We are going to extend the same flow by adding additional functionality so the caller would be offered with a callback later.

1. Open your flow **Main_Flow_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>** and switch **Edit: Off** mode to **Edit: On**
2. Delete  connection from **Queue** node to **Music** 
3. Drag **Menu** node:

    > Rename Activity Label to **WantCallback**<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="WantCallback"><span class="copy"></span></span>
    >
    > Enable Text-To-Speech
    >
    > Select the Connector: **Cisco Cloud Text-to-Speech**
    >
    > Click the Add Text-to-Speech Message button and paste text: ***All agents are busy. Please press 1 if you want to schedule a callback. Press 2 if you want to wait in queue.***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="All agents are busy. Please press 1 if you want to schedule a callback. Press 2 if you want to wait in queue.laBlaBla"><span class="copy"></span></span>
    >
    > Delete the Selection for Audio File
    >
    > Under Custom Menu Links:
    >>
    >> Change first Digit Number **0** to **1**, add Link Description as **Callback** 
    >>
    >> Add New Digit Number as **2** with Link Description **Stay in queue**
    >
    > Connect existing **Queue** node to **WantCallBack** node
    >
    > Connect **No-Input Timeout** to the front of the **WantCallBack** node
    >
    > Connect **Unmatched Entry** to the front of the **WantCallBack** node

    > Callback Dial Number select  ***NewNumber.DigitsEntered***<span class="copy-static" data-copy-text="NewNumber.DigitsEntered"><span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span> from dropdown list
    >

    >
    > Delete the Selection for Audio File
    >
    > Connect **CallBack** created in step 6 to **PlayMessage** node
    > Connect **PlayMessage** created in step 6 to **DisconnectCall** node

8. Validate the flow by clicking **Validate**, **Publish** and select the Latest version of the flow

    
### Testing
    
1. Make sure you're logged into Webex CC Desktop application as Agent and set status to **Not Available**. In this case call will not be assigned to an agent and callback will be proposed to a caller.
2. Make a call to the Support Number and if success you should hear configured messages.

3. When callback is proposed, press 1 on Webex App DialPad to request a callback. 

4. When asked, provide a new number for a callback. Because in current lab we are having number limitations we are going to provide a wellknown Cisco Worldwide Support contact number **1 408 526 7209**<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="+14085267209"><span class="copy"></span></span> as a callback number. Use DialPad to provide Cisco TAC number then confirm when asked.
3. Once done another message about successful scheduling should play.
4. Make your agent **Available**. Contact Center will reserve you right away and propose to answer a callback call.

**Congratulations on completing another mission.**
